Modelator is a tool that enables automatic generation of tests from models.
Modelator takes [TLA+ models](https://mbt.informal.systems/docs/tla_basics_tutorials/tutorial.html) as its input and generates tests that can be run against an implementation of the model.

Under the hood, Modelator uses [Apalache](https://apalache.informal.systems/), our in-house model checker, to generate tests from models.

Modelator is used by [Atomkraft](https://github.com/informalsystems/atomkraft), a testing framework for the [Cosmos blockchains network](https://cosmos.network/).

# Installing Modelator

First, make sure your system has

- `Python 3.8` or newer
- `Java 17` or newer

To install Modelator, simply run `pip install modelator`.
That's it! Please verify that the tool is working by writing `modelator` on the command line.
You should see something like this:

For detailed installation instructions and clarifications of dependencies, check [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md)

# Using Modelator

For a full example of running Modelator together with the system implementation and the corresponding TLA+ model, see the [Towers of Hanoi example](examples/hanoi).

To see all commands of the Modelator CLI, run `modelator --help`.

The command `apalache` provides the info about the current version of Apalache installed and enables you to download different versions.
(In order to check the usage of this command, run `modelator apalache --help`.
Do the same for details of all other commands.)

Commands `load`, `info`, and `reset` are used to manipulate the default value for a TLA+ model.
(A default version is not strictly necessary since a model can always be given as an argument.)

The most useful commands are `simulate`, `sample`, and `check`.
Command `simulate` will generate a number of (randomly chosen) behaviors described by the model.
If you would like to obtain a particular model behavior, use command `sample`: it will generate behaviors described by a TLA+ predicate.
Finally, to check if a TLA+ predicate is an invariant of the model, use `check`.
To see all the options of these commands, run `modelator simulate --help`, `modelator sample --help`, or `modelator check --help`.
