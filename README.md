The framework and tools for model-based testing.

## Usage

There are two ways to use `modelator` - as a cli app or as a library.

### CLI

The latest release,
```
cargo install modelator
```

The `main` branch,
```
cargo install --git https://github.com/informalsystems/modelator
```

Make sure `$HOME/.cargo/bin` is added to your system path. Check the `modelator --help` for usage instructions.

### Library

Currently we support [`rust`](rust) and [`golang`](golang) libraries. Please refer to the `README.md`s at [`rust`](rust/README.md) and [`golang`](golang/README.md) directories for more details.

## Resources

Currently it is possible to view the docs book only if [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) is installed. Then the book can be viewed by navigating to `docs/`, running `mdbook serve` and then navigating to `localhost:3000` in your browser.
